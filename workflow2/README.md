# Florence — Automated Medication Reminder & Tracking System

Hi everyone!
Florence is an automated system I built to help nurses manage patient medications with accuracy, consistency, and ease.

Nurses work under pressure, and keeping track of every patient’s medication schedule can be overwhelming. Florence solves that by handling reminders, tracking, and documentation — automatically.

🚑 What Florence Does
🔔 Sends automated medication reminders

Three times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner), Florence sends a message directly to the nurse’s Telegram, including:

Patient name

Age

Medication

Dosage

Special instructions

📝 Tracks completion automatically

When the nurse replies “done”, Florence updates the Google Sheet instantly.

If no confirmation is given, the task is marked as not done.

Every update includes the exact date and time.

📊 Maintains organized records

All daily medication tasks are logged in a Google Sheet to provide a clean, structured, and reliable digital record.

💡 Why It Matters

Reduces the risk of missed or incorrect doses

Keeps nurses organized during busy shifts

Improves patient safety

Supports healthcare workers by removing repetitive manual work
