This project automates the responsibilities of a human school assistant.
It handles every step of the student-processing workflow, including:

📄 Managing each student’s file from a spreadsheet

✏️ Filling in or updating the student’s information

🔢 Calculating the final score automatically

📝 Determining whether the student is admitted or not

📬 Sending the result back to the student

This automation is designed to reduce manual work, avoid human errors, and ensure faster, more consistent processing.
