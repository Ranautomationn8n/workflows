# 📚 YouTube Physics Auto-Publisher Workflow

I’ve always loved reading and writing, but watching long YouTube videos — especially with ads — can be exhausting.
That’s why I built this automation workflow: to turn physics YouTube videos into readable articles, completely automatically.

🔍 How It Works
1. Track My Favorite Physics Channels

The workflow starts by monitoring my two preferred physics YouTube channels.
Every time a new video is published, the workflow gathers all the metadata and stores it in a structured data table.

📝 2. Transcribe & Analyze Each Video

If the video is new and hasn’t been processed before:

The video is automatically transcribed.

An AI evaluation agent reviews the content.

It decides whether the video is worth turning into an article.

🛑 3. If the Video Doesn’t Qualify

If the AI determines the video is not worth publishing, the workflow:

Sends me an email

Includes the reason it was rejected

Provides all video details for review

No time wasted on low-value content.

✅ 4. If the Video Is Worth Publishing

If the video passes the evaluation:

The AI rewrites it into a clean, structured article-style text

The article is automatically published

I receive an email summary with all the important details

This allows me to stay updated without watching long videos or sitting through ads.

🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted a system that:

Saves time

Removes distractions

Turns videos into something I actually enjoy: well-written articles

Keeps me updated on physics content efficiently

This workflow does exactly that — fully automated, reliable, and tailored to how I prefer to learn.
